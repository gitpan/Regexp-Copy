NAME
    Regexp::Copy - copy Regexp objects

SYNOPSIS
      use Regexp::Copy qw( re_copy );

      my $re1 = qr/Hello!/;
      my $re2 = qr/Goodbye!/;

      re_copy($re1, $re2);

      print "ok\n" if 'Goodbye!' =~ $re1;

DESCRIPTION
    "Regexp::Copy" allows you to copy the contents of one Regexp object to
    another. A problem that I have found with the qr// operator is that the
    Regexp objects that it creates are is impossible to dereference. This
    causes problems if you want to change the data in the regexp without
    losing the reference to it. Its impossible. Regexp::Copy allows you to
    change the Regexp by copying one object created through qr// to another.

    This module came about through discussions on the London.pm mailing list
    in regards to attempts various people had made to serialize objects with
    qr// created Regexp objects in them.

FUNCTIONS
    re_copy(FROM, TO)
        The "re_copy" function copies the regular expression magic contained
        within the variable FROM to the variable named in TO.

THANKS TO
    Piers Cawley, who provided the magic Pixie::Info code, that forms the
    basis of Regexp::Copy.
